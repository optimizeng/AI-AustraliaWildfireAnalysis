# AI-AustraliaWildfireAnalysis - A Machine Learning Approach

**Exploratory analysis of wildfires in Australia & a machine learning approach for wildfire modeling on Google Earth Engine**

Earth's free remotely sensed data provides a means to analyze Australian wildfires. This study investigates data from Earth observation to uncover general insights about these fires. Recent years have seen machine learning (ML) being successful in many domains because it's capable of learning from hidden relationships.

In this study, the overall objec
